# My personal neovim setup

When I configured Neovim myself as a layman, it was a nightmare. I'll be honest: I was overwhelmed. 
Maybe this repo will help someone in the future to configure Neovim for their purposes. 
Important: It would be unwise to just clone my repo and do anything without knowing how it works or what the point is. Believe me, even if you save time in the short term, you will regret it in the future.

Currently I use Neovim for Java Development & Latex, but I will definitely extend it for future purposes.

Have fun!
